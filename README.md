# Major League Baseball API

This project is a REST API that provides access to the "Major League Baseball Dataset" from Kaggle. It leverages the power of Scala 3 and the ZIO framework to build a functional and scalable backend application. The API allows users to retrieve game history, make predictions for future games, and initialize the underlying H2 database engine.
